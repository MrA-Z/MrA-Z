- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MrA-Z
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m currently a MSc student major in Transport at Imperial College London. I am interested in data science, and wish to learn more about machine learning,
deep learning and artificial intelligence, but my coding skill is not good enough and as a result, I am here.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python and R, and other useful tools to get me a headstart. I also signed up for a data science series course on coursera held by IBM.
Wish that I can finish it as soon as possible because I would have a lot more school courses for my master degree.
- And that's so much about me, time to keep up! Bye!
